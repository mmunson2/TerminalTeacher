# TerminalTeacher

An online Unix terminal emulator with a built-in tutor to help users learn commands.


## About

I built this project for a web development class. While its aesthetics might indicate otherwise, it's a React-based app with a terminal implemented entirely in Javascript. While it was mostly an excuse to implement a JS file system, it could have some educational value if it was expanded to suggest that users try things such as different command options/arguments.
